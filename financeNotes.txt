[ Futures market ]

- is a zero sum game

[ Futures pricing ]

- future price mimics underlying stock spot price

- but they are not same 

Future Price = Spot Price * (1 + R (x/365) - D)

R = risk free rate. eg Treasury bill annual rate
x = number of days for expiry
D - dividend expected if any

This is because
- in futures there is no need to spend money while buying and can instead be put in 
safe treasury bills for interest. In spot market buying, money is spent
- like wise in spot market we get dividend when holding shares. In futures we dont, hence subtracted

- in practice some minor difference will be there to account for transaction charge, any tax etc

- With more number of days to expiry , the difference widens and narrows near expiry

- Cost of Carry = R(x/365)

Premium / Contango - when futures is trading at a price more than spot
Discount - when futures is trading at a price less than spot

The prices will always converge as same on expiry date 


[ Spread ]

- Buy cheaper asset and sell expensive asset
eg if future is trading more than fair value

Sell future at that price
But stock at spot price
On expiry prices will converge. 
The above trade will make profit no matter where market moves


[ Beta ]

- Correlation of a stock wrt index
- It can be +ve / -ve
- eg If beta of ITC is 1.2, it means
- when nifty goes up by 1% ITC moves up by 1.2%

- calculated using slope function in excel

p[i] = list of closing  prices for say 6 months
daily return r[i] = ( p[i] - p[i-1] ) / p[i-1]
x[i] = daily return of nifty
y[i] = daily return of stock

beta = slope(y[i], x[i])


Portfolio beta  = weighted average of beta across stocks in portfolio

weight w[i] = value of stock s[i] / total portfolio value

Portfolio Beta =  Sum(w[i] * b[i])

[ Hedging ]

- you can hedge a stock position in spot market, by buying futures in opposite direction
- irrespective of market direction, you will have a no profit - no loss situation
- note - it also means even if market moves up, you will have a net gain of zero

Portfolio hedging with index futures
Hedge value = index futures *  portfolio beta
- hedge this amount in futures market , in opposite direction 
- ie short it, in case of long only portfolio 

[ Open Interest ]

- the total number of contracts outstanding

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
[ Options ]

- you can exercise options only on the day of expiry and not before that
- In India it is last thursday of current month, next month, and the one after that
- option premium will vary based on time to expiry and risk perception

- there is no margin requirement for call option buyer. As he only pays premium.
- but the option writer need to put up margin, as he bears unlimited risk

Call options - right to buy option at a certain price
Put option - right to sell option at a certain price
Option writing - sell option

- buyer of call option makes profit only if stock spot price increases above premium hurdle 

[European options / American options]

- CE - European Call option
can only exercise on expiry day based on spot price

- American options
can exercise any day
so is more risky for option writer and hence premiums are higher

- In india now it is only European options available


- If outlook is bullish , you can buy call option or sell put option
- Which one to choose depends on how attractive the premiums are

[ Options premium trading ] 

- *Most of the option trading is based on the change in premiums*
ie instead of waiting for expiry , we can trade options if it now commands higher premium than we paid
- Generally speaking option sellers tend to hold contracts till expiry rather than option buyers. 
- This is because if you have written an option for Rs.8/- you will enjoy the full premium received i.e. Rs.8/- only on expiry.
